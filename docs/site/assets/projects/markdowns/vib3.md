I developed **VIB3** NPM package because three.js requires 
a lot of boilerplate code to be able to create any 3D scenes. 
Additionally, more boilerplate code is needed for pages to be
responsive and high resolution. **VIB3** abstracts out all of 
these boilerplate code while allowing a developer to configure
any portion to their desire. More details can be found [here][1].
