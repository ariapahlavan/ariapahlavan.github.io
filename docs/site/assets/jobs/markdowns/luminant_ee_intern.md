My summer project at Luminant Power was to develop a technical
specification for an electrical transformer. To do so, I broke down the
project into three steps: collaboration, research and development.

First, I collaborated with electrical, mechanical and civil engineering
teams outside my group to gather valuable technical requirements
regarding the transformer.

Second, I researched different industry standards for
transformers used in power plants.

last, I compiled the resources and data together to develop the desired
purchase specification, which was approved by my mentor.

I believe that collaborating with other engineering disciplines
tremendously increased the reliability of my proposal.
