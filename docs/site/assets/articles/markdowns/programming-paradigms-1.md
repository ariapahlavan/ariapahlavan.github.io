What on earth are different programming paradigms? 
Why should we care to learn about them? 

The good news is that we've already probably learned
about two of them: **procedural** and **object-oriented** 
programming. Both of these programming paradigms are 
derived from the **imperative** paradigm.

Almost everyone learns about procedural and/or
object-oriented programming languages academically or
professionally.

Why is it that we are only learn about 
languages from these two programming paradigms in 
college? ðŸ¤”
